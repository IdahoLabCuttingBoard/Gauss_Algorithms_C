# Gauss Algorithms (C Version)

*This project is not currently supported by Idaho National Laboratory as production grade software but is being made available to the public. Please use at your own risk.*

The Gauss Algorithms have been developed for use in analyzing gamma-ray spectra
and are available as a library of compiled functions. They can be used to develop
spectroscopy systems for nuclear research, waste management, national security, and
other application areas.

This version of the Gauss Algorithms is the last version implemented in native C. More recent versions have migrated to an implementation written in Java with a C wrapper library that may be used from native code needing to call into the library. The more recent version can be found at [https://github.com/idaholab/GaussAlgorithms](https://github.com/idaholab/GaussAlgorithms). This version is still made available for those who may wish to continue using the native version but this code base is no longer supported by INL.

## HISTORY

This venerable software has been in continuous use and production here at Idaho National Laboratories since 1963 giving it one of the oldest software pedigrees there is. We are proud to make this freely available to the public and provide a brief history of its major releases, both as a standalone library (this release) or as part of a larger application.
